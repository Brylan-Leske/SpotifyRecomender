# SpotifyRecomender
A web app that makes getting specific spotify recomendations, based on artists, genres, and albums, easier than ever! I built this after the create similar playlist feature was removed.


# Usage
To start, you'll want to edit the clientId and redirectUrl variables in script.js with the values you add in the spotify developer dashboard.

Next, using NPM you can start the web app and go to it.

Once on the site, click log in with spotify and your ready. You can enter up to five parameters in any combination of track, artist, and albums. Limit sets how many recommendations to generate, it can be anywhere from 1 to 100. Enter the ids of each parameter, those can be gotten by holding control or option key while clicking share on the spotify website, or by copying it from the url.

Click create playlist to generate recomendations, then press add to library to add the playlist to your spotify library.
